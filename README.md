# tals-python-for-data-science

Welcome to Python Learnings Series with Tal Yifat!

The series is designed to offer a flexible learning opportunities for learners with different needs and backgrounds. Each session includes a Jupyter Notebook, and if you're within MetLife's network, you can also find a video recording of the live session. The notebooks allow you to follow the lesson and experiment with the code yourself. You are also welcome to go through the notebook on your own without the video.

The first series discusses the fundamentals of programming in Python, with each session covering one or more topics. The second series is focused on Python for data science, and it takes learners through the different stages of a single data science project.
